2. If a website only allows HTTP connections, is it more or less at risk from SQL injection attacks?

3. Suppose you have found a new remote code execution vulnerability in Firefox that only requires users to browse your evil website to be succesfully exploited. Would you expect to get root / administrative rights on computers that browse your site with vulnerable browsers?

4. Do non-executable stacks stop stack-based return-to-libc attacks? Why, why not?
